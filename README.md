# About
No code here just a read me. 

Not skilled in code. Just familar enough to dig arround. To get into trouble. I have written a little but as my bio says the last programn I wrote that worked was on a calculator. Since then I have done web authoring under HTML 4.0 and maged qa few simple sites with more than 200 pages. I dont do java or dot net so dont ask. I really have no idea how to read the stuff. 

#So, if your not a developer why are you here?
Honestly you can blame the Marlin community. Becuase untill I started to learn about compilling code for Marlin I had never been to github. In that process I made a few friends including one who published some guides with data I had started to collect.

Today, I am working with the AI as a means to accomplish mean years worth of development I was never able to get done. Some simple, some complex. Some of these projects are public and many are private. Due to potential over lap with work related projects many are private, even if they don't actively cross lines. -Some folks think they own everything. 

#I am happily working on:
1) Post Processors for Marlin and Fusion360, and another for NextWave machines to work with Fusion360. 
It's not like these are so complex but, few to none have put the time in. So now I have. I am tired of asking the developers. 
2)  A tool to help with new ellectronics projects.
3)  A tool to help protect 3d printers
4)  A tool to help protect 120v connected hardware
5)  A tool to help with Drafting
6)  A tool for battery testing
7)  A weather station for durring the storm
8)  code for better battery tracking
9)  code for batter battery management
10)  copy of my setting from CNCjs applicable to other CNCjs users who also use Marlin with CNC
11)  a game for a friend using nixipixels
12)
