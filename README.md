### About:
No code here just a read me. 

Not skilled in code. Just familar enough to dig arround. To get into trouble. I have written a little but as my bio says the last programn I wrote that worked was on a calculator. Since then I have done web authoring under HTML 4.0 and managed few simple sites with more than 200 pages. I don't do java or dot net so don't ask. I really have no idea how to read the stuff. C and C++, I am reasonably familiar. But Dont trade familiarity with expertice. I can write a little and do edditing with effort and help. But most of you are here beciadse you have more significant skill. 

### So, if your not a developer why are you here?
Honestly you can blame the Marlin community. Becuase untill I started to learn about compilling code for Marlin I had never been to github. In that process I made a few friends including one who published some guides with data I had started to collect. I used to occationaly chat with the admin on the facebook marlin page, though limited as he's always buisy. Eventualy I got better hardware and migrated to Discord. I have had way more chats with the founder of M3D. 

Today, I am working with the AI as a means to accomplish many years worth of development I was never able to get done. Some simple, some complex. Some of these projects are public and many are private. Due to potential over lap with work related projects and NDAs many are private, even if they don't actively cross lines. -Some folks think they own everything. So stuff that doesnt need to be secret gets banned. Thank lawyers who get paid way too much for the little effort they put in. 

### Do I think this will get me a job or make me wealthy? 
Hell, no. I am not that naive. It's all a huge waste of time. I am probably going to help a few people, and they will like me for a moment. Thats it. No more love. Certainly not enough to even fun any work. Afterall, I am doing the work on AI, and most will consider it cheating even if they personaly would have refused to help when asked. Mind you I pay like 14.00 a month to do this and there are still limits. Meanwhile I pay Autodesk like 45 a month and it's never earned me one penny meanwhile the account is comercial...

### I am happily working on (that I am not porohibited to talk about): 
-Does some of this already exist? Probably. But I am not made of cash. Why buy a program that comes with a subscription that never ends, when I can easily author something very specific to what I am trying to do? In a way this is very much the same premmis as to why to have a 3d printer? Why pay hundreds for a custom part I can make at home for a few dollars. -Insert quote about teaching a man to fish. 

01)  Post Processors for Marlin and Fusion360, and another for NextWave machines to work with Fusion360: (It's not like these are so complex, but few to none have been willing put the time in. So now I have. I am tired of asking for help. I got help, from AI, it didn't make excuses.) 
02)  A tool to help with new electronics projects: having trouble with all those files needed to assemble parts your developer refused to add to the catalogue? This will solve that. 
03)  A tool to help protect 3d printers: A printer can shut itself down to protect from fire but it cannot stop a short circuit, or bad mosfet. This can. 
04)  A tool to help protect 120v connected hardware: How do you know when its time to replace your machines? This will tell you. 
05)  A tool to help with Drafting: Ever spent much time reverse engineering and trying to get that data into the computer accurately? I have. 
06)  A tool for battery testing: Plug it in choose the test, battery type, get a fuly charged battery and report. 
07)  
08)  A weather station for durring the storm: Its not the storm, its how long to keep hiding and the air you breath while staying safe. 
09)  code for better battery tracking: for accurate level monitoring, no voltage based guesswork nonsense. 
10)  code for batter battery management: Lets make sure we are in line with all safety measures and our batteries are stable, not just assume they are. 
11)  copy of my setting from CNCjs applicable to other CNCjs users who also use Marlin with CNC:
12)  a game for a friend using nixipixels:
13)  inventory management database:
14)  software to process and sort data from multiple test devices:
15)  software to compile heatmaps into 3d:
16)  A custom 3D printer that can be used for advanced testing but not printing. 
17)
